Brain Tumor Classification:
This project focuses on the classification of brain tumors into three categories: Benign, Malignant, and Normal. The dataset used for this classification task was meticulously collected from a local city hospital, ensuring the authenticity and relevance of the data.

Machine Learning Algorithms Utilized:
  >Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 87%. This algorithm helps in finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different tumor categories.
  >K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier: Also achieved an accuracy of 87%. This instance-based learning algorithm classifies tumors based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.
  >Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 69%. This model uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences to classify the tumor types.
  >Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 87%. This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and robustness.

Deployment:
For deployment, the Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its high accuracy and ability to handle complex data with less risk of overfitting.
